The **hardEXP** module allows you to adjust the global experience rate on your AzerothCore server. With this module, you can set custom experience rates (e.g., 0.1x for 10% of the default XP) to create a more challenging gameplay experience.

---

## **Features**
- **Customizable Global XP Rate**: Adjust the experience rate for all players.
- **Easy Configuration**: Modify the experience rate via a simple `.conf` file.
- **Client-Side Compatibility**: Displays the correct XP amount in the client UI.
- **No Database Changes Required**: Fully script-based and easy to install.

## **Installation**

### 1. Clone the Module
Clone this repository into your `modules` directory:
```bash
cd path/to/azerothcore/modules
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hardEXP.git
```

### 2. Import Configuration
Copy the configuration file to your server's `etc` directory:
```bash
cp modules/hardEXP/conf/mod_hardexp.conf.dist etc/worldserver.conf.d/mod_hardexp.conf
```

### 3. Recompile the Core
Recompile AzerothCore to include the new module:
```bash
cd path/to/azerothcore/build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

---

## **Configuration**
Edit the configuration file (`etc/worldserver.conf.d/mod_hardexp.conf`) to set your desired experience rate:

```ini
[hardEXP]
# XP Rate (0.1 = 10% of default XP)
XpRate = 0.1
```

---

## **How It Works**
- The module hooks into the `OnGiveXP` event and adjusts the experience gained by players.
- The adjusted XP amount is displayed correctly in the client UI.
- The configuration is reloaded automatically when the server restarts.
